This project is part of a series of practical assignments focused on implementing and testing security measures within a Windows domain, carrying out offensive reconnaissance, writing tooling for the detection and exploitation of vulnerabilities, and assessing & selecting cryptographic protocols. The Network Scanner is the first tool in this series, designed to scan and analyze network environments using Python's socket and Scapy modules.

## Assignment 2: Network Scanner
For this assignment we had to make a network scanner in python, while using the nmap module as least as possible

### Features
- **Subnet Scan**: The ability to scan a full subnet, but also one specific host
- **Arp request**: Get the Ip and MAc address of a target using an arp request broadcast
- **Port and service Scanning**: Enumerate open ports on targeted hosts while retrieving the service behind it
- **Host and OS name**: Able to retrieve not only the hostname, but also the os name of the targeted host(s)

### To do
- **All in one**: Now some features are in a second file, lets turn this into one
- **Command line flags**: Its a bonus, so I guess I have to add some flags
- **Progress**: Adding print statements to show progress reports. This will be my first time that print statements are a feature and not for testing
- **Colors**: I don't know why, but I have to print using colors?? So I guess this is a to do topic

### Installation
1. Clone the repo
2. Run the main.py file
3. ?
4. Profit
